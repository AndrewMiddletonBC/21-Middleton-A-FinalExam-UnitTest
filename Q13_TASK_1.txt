Step 1: Write necissary tests for the new features.
  - One test to ensure adding with a negative number will throw an exception
  - One test to ensure that numbers bigger than 1000 are ignored in the output
Step 2: Start main coding loop
  - Run tests
  - if no failed tests, break to step 3, else finish step 2 and keep repeating it.
  - For a failing test, add to the code in StringCalculator to attempt to make it pass
Step 3: Refactor code
  - reorganize to make things neater
  - run tests along the way to make sure nothing breaks
Step 4: Submit new design
  - only do this when all tests pass and the code is well formatted and efficient
